%! retrhow(:Goal, +Catcher, +Exception) is det.
% Catches an exception that is thrown lower in the stack, and reappropriates
% it for a new exception, to be caught by another method higher in the stack.
% This is used to provide more detailed ('higher-level') information for
% more generic ('lower-level') exceptions.
%
% Example: =convert_to_jpeg= catches the exception thrown by
% =convert_to_anything= and adds the more specific information that it is a
% conversion to *jpeg* that causes the exception, reusing a generic exception
% for convesions.

% @param Goal
% @param Catcher
