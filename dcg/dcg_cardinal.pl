/** <module> Processing cardinal numbers in DCGs

Library `dcg/basics` comes with the following rules for cardinals:
  - `float//1`
  - `integer//1`
  - `number//1`

Sometimes we want to process integers between a given lower and upper bound:

  - between//[2,3]
    Processes integers between the given lower and higher bounds.
  - between_digit//[2,3]
    Processes digits between the given lower and higher bounds.
    `hex` is defined as `or([between(0,9),oneof([a,b,c,d,e,f])])`.
  - between_radix//[2,3]
    The values are either integers (in decimal base) or compound terms
    (`bin/1`, `oct/1`, `dec/1`, `hex/1`)
    representing numbers in different bases
    (binary, octal, hexadecimal).

### Example:

```prolog
?- phrase(between_radix(bin(1001), hex(f), oct(X)), Codes).
X = 11,
Codes = [57] ;
X = 12,
Codes = [49, 48] ;
X = 13,
Codes = [49, 49] ;
X = 14,
Codes = [49, 50] ;
X = 15,
Codes = [49, 51] ;
X = 16,
Codes = [49, 52] ;
X = 17,
Codes = [49, 53].
```

Besides integers (base 10) we sometimes want to write digits and numbers in
other bases (2, 8, 16).
