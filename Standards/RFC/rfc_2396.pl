/** <module> URI

A grammar and a description of basic functionality for URI.

"This document defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URI,
such that an implementation can parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier type. This document does not define a generative
grammar for URI; that task will be performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme."

# Abbreviations

    * Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      A means for identifying a resource.
    * Resource
